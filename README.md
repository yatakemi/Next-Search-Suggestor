# Next Search Suggestor

A Chrome extension that generates the next most likely Google search links based on the information from the sites the user has visited, using Chrome's built-in AI.

I created this for the [Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=homepage-recommended-hackathons), but unfortunately, I missed the deadline due to a misunderstanding.

## How to Use:

1. Build: Run pnpm build.
1. Load Extension: Load the `dist` directory as a Chrome extension in developer mode.
1. Enable Chrome Built-in AI: Activate Chrome's built-in AI feature.
