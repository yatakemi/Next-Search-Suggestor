# Next Search Suggestor

A Chrome extension that generates the next most likely Google search links based on the information from the sites the user has visited, using Chrome's built-in AI.

I created this for the [Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=homepage-recommended-hackathons), but unfortunately, I missed the deadline due to a misunderstanding.
